# tpitemtracker 1.2 

A map tracker for The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess

Version 1.2: Logic and Cosmetics

What's new in this version?

Updated Logic!
- I took some time to pick around at the logic and make sure that everything is as flushed out as can currently be. This will probably change with the code rework

Cosmetic/QoL Changes

- Check Counter:
    Allows you to keep track of the number of checks you have available and how many are left in the game

- Map Distance:
   Allows you to set the distance between the map tracker and the item tracker.
   
- Background Image:
    Allows you to add some character to your tracker by setting the background image to one of 3 preset images
 
- Tracker Opacity:
    Allows you to set how transparent the background of your tracker (more noticible if there is a background open.
